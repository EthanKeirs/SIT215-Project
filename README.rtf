This repository contains the code for Deakin SIT215 Investigating Reinforcement Learning Project by Ethan G. Keirs(220250887).

Task requirement 2 “Read and complete the following tutorial: https:/www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/reinforcement-q- learning-scratch-python-openai-gym/, ensuring that you can reproduce all steps discussed” can be found as the Taxi.ipynb file. This should be run through jupternotebook

Task requirement 4 “Complete the following tutorial to explore the Cart-Pole environment in the Gym: http://kvfrans.com/simple-algoritms-for-solving-cartpole/.” Can be found in the crat-pole-code folder which contains a random policy file, a Q-learning file and a policy gradient method file. This should be run through terminal

The environments used are
1. Taxi-v3  (https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v3/)
2. Cartpole-v1 (https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/)
3. FrozenLake-v0  (https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/)


The graphs were made used the src and driver code files they should also be run in terminal
